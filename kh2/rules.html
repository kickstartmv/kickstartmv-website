          <h3>Teams</h3>
          <p>Participants may choose to participate in the hackathon as a team or form a team by inviting other participants at the event to join.</p>

          <p>A team must have a maximum of 3 members and all members of the team must be a builder (i.e. a developer or designer).</p>

          <p>Use the project pitch time to entice others to join or to find people to team-up with. If you are looking for an idea to work on, please check the <a href="/ideas">Kickstart Idea Bank</a>.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Code, Design and other Assets</h3>
          <p>To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design and assets must be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, open source libraries. <strong>We take this rule very seriously</strong> for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification.</p>

          <p>If your team qualifies for prizes, the organizers may review your code and assets to verify the team may be subjected to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.</p>

          <h4>APIs, Services, and Open Source</h4>
          <p>The exception to the above rule is you are encouraged to use 3rd party libraries, APIs, frameworks & libraries in your projects. For example: jQuery, firebase, parse</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Ownership and Licenses</h3>
          <p>Any software and systems developed at the hackathon will remain the property of the respective developer(s). Developers may choose to release their project as open-source software with a license of their liking, or keep their project private or may offer it for sale.</p>

          <hr>
          
          <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
          <p>We value the participation of each member of the developer community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event.</p>
          <p>Organizers will enforce the following Code of Conduct throughout the event.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Be Respectful</h4>
              <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment* and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.</p>
              <p><em>* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, political, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</em></p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Be Open</h4>
              <p>We welcome attendees from all backgrounds and skill levels - from “never been to hackathon before” to experts. This event is about increasing the overall amount of innovation, partnership, and engagement in the developer community.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Be Awesome</h4>
              <p>Do your best. Meet new people. Have fun. Getting something meaningful done within such a short amount of time can be stressful, but we'd like to encourage everyone to take a break every now and then to relax and enjoy the event.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the Hackathon at the sole discretion of the Hackathon organizers. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
